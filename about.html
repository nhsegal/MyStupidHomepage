        I have been a high school physics for many years in the United States, 
        and have worked at several highly competitive independent schools. Despite the content of this website, 
        I am <em>not</em> a big proponent of using simluations in the classroom. They have their place, especially 
        during a global pandemic, but practica, exploration, and experimentation in the offline world, with the 
        accompanying challenges and messiness, have always been central to my instruction. I have recently been 
        thrust into online teaching and tutoring. Some these sims were developed in response to that environment.
        Others came about as part of an effort to teach myself coding or explore particular mathematical ideas.
