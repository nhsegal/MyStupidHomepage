      <div class="welcome">Welcome!</div>
      I am a physics teacher who has dabbled a little in coding over the years, and this website hosts some of the math- and physics-related simulations I've coded.  
      Some of these simulations I have used in the classroom or for online teaching. Others are were pursued out of personal interest. 
      Many of the simulations were developed using the fabulous <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js library</a>, which unfortunately means they won't run in the Safari browsers but should work in Firefox or Chrome. 
      Also, I have not attempted to make the simulations compatible with tablets or mobile browsers. Nonetheless, I hope they may be of use to others.

            A virtual version of the constant velocity and constant acceleration labs popularized by Modeling Physics. The ruler is draggable.

      This is a virtual version of a real lab I did with students during the energy unit. Students vary the mass of a projectile launched vertically from a spring toy and measure the maximum height. 
       From these measurements they determine the elastic energy stored in the toy. In the sim, the energy and color of the toy launcher is randomized. The rulers are draggable.

       I wanted something that clearly showed the vertical placement of the blocks on the pegboard does not affect its balance.

       This very rudimentary sim was inspired by a bowling ball activity that I first learned of from physics teacher Mark Schober.
       My students often had difficulty idealizing the results of the physical lab, so this sim was a helpful supplement. 
       I used the handout <a href="https://github.com/nhsegal/Bowling-Ball-Activity/blob/gh-pages/2.0%20Bowling%20Ball%20Activity.pdf">here</a> as a guide for them.
       (If the sim has trouble loading, open the developer console in Chrome or the browser console in Firefox and reload the webpage. You can then close the console window.)

     Both the Modeling Physics curriculum and AP Physics C often ask students to make graphs that "linearize" their data. I developed an activity to help students in 9th grade physics understand this process.
       <a href="https://github.com/nhsegal/linearingData/blob/master/3.1%20Linearization%20activity%20wtih%20real%20stuff.pdf">Here is the handout. </a>The paragraphs in the activity are from <a href="http://www.denofinquiry.com/pdf/DOI%20vol%202%202007.02.03.pdf"><em>A Den of Inquiry</em></a>. I found out about it from Frank Noschese.
       I have not yet tried out the sim with students. I don't think the sim will be as effective as the activity, but it might be an aid students find useful.  <p></p>

    This sim is essentially a replica of a sim on vectors by PhET at UC Boulder.
       The PhET sim is coded in Flash, which is often blocked by browsers. I rewrote it in javascript mostly to
       practice coding. I do not use it for a student activity, but I have found it helpful to illustrate ideas during the first lecture introducing vectors.

            <!--
    The inspiration for this sim comes from David Mermin's book <i>It's About Time</i>. That book can best describe how to interpret this sim.
       I have used the sim to illustrate points during lecture and to make figures for worksheets. The sim depicts the worldlines of two clocks -
       one colored black, one colored red. The user can adjust the velocity of each clock and see how time dilates accordingly.
       The user can also chose to display lines marking simultaneous events for the black clock and/or the red clock.
       One can develop a sense of how two clocks in relative motion each measure the other as time dilated.

      Another sim inspired by <i>It's About Time</i>. Mermin devotes a whole chapter in the book to explaining the concept behind this sim.

       This sim and the following were inspired by Feynman's book <i>QED</i> and by sections of <i>Feynman's Lectures in Physics</i>.
       My apologies for not fully explaining the sims' use here or within the links themselves.
       Edwin F. Taylor describes educational software and an "Action first" approach to physics <a href="http://www.eftaylor.com/leastaction.html">here</a>.
       I originally thought I could develop something along these lines, before realizing that the project was too ambitious for me.
