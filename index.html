      <div class="welcome">Welcome!</div>
      I am a physics teacher who has dabbled a little in coding over the years, and this website hosts some of the 
      math- and physics-related simulations I've coded. Despite the content of this website, I am <em>not</em> a 
      big proponent of using simluations in the classroom. They have their place, especially during a global 
      pandemic. However, practica, exploration, and experimentation in the offline world - with their accompanying 
      challenges and messiness - have always been central to my instruction. I coded these sims partly as a challenge to 
      myself and partly to meet quite specific needs I had in the classroom. Recent forays into online teaching 
      and tutoring have spurred me to develop several sims of activities I have traditionally done in the classroom and 
      have motivated to collect my projects together in a single website.   
      <p>
      Most of the stuff below were developed using the fabulous <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js library</a>. 
      Some of these sims need a great deal more polish, and except for the iPhone accerometer app, which only works on mobile devices, 
      I have not attempted to make the simulations compatible with tablets or mobile browsers. Nonetheless, I hope they may be of use to others, if not "as-is" then perhaps as 
      inspriration for someone to code their own sims for teaching.

                  This is a virtual version of a real lab I did with students during the energy unit. Students vary the mass of a projectile launched vertically from a spring toy and measure the maximum height. 
                  From these measurements they determine the elastic energy stored in the toy. In the sim, the energy and color of the toy launcher is randomized. The rulers are draggable.

                This is a virtual version of an activity with pegboard that students do to explore torque or center of mass. Although PhET and Physicsclassroom.com have excellent torque sims, 
                I wanted something that clearly showed that the vertical placement of the blocks on the pegboard does not affect the conditions for equilibrium.

                    This very rudimentary sim was inspired by a bowling ball activity that I first learned of from physics teacher Mark Schober.
                    My students often had difficulty idealizing the results of the physical lab, so this sim was a helpful supplement. 
                    I used the handout <a href="https://github.com/nhsegal/Bowling-Ball-Activity/blob/gh-pages/2.0%20Bowling%20Ball%20Activity.pdf">here</a> as a guide for them.
                    (If the sim has trouble loading, open the developer console in Chrome or the browser console in Firefox and reload the webpage. You can then close the console window.)

                  Like PhET Waves on a String, but students are challenged to apply their knowledge of interference and reflection to hit or avoid spots near the string. 
                  I tried coding the physics for wave motion in three or four ways. I learned a lot about the sorts of errors that result from various physical approximations, 
                  but I ended up back where I started with not much to show for my efforts.

                Students experimentally determine the relationship between the spacing of two wave sources and the angle between interference maxima. 
                The slider controls the spacing and the red circle can be moved to measure angles.
                Students can then apply the relationship they determined to find the wavelength of a real laser with a reall double slit and ruler. 
                I do this lab in the classroom with concentric circles printed on overhead transparencies. 
                It is easier for the students to follow than deriving the relationship using similar triangles and small angle approximations.

                  Both the Modeling Physics curriculum and AP Physics C often ask students to make graphs that "linearize" their data. 
                  I developed an activity to help students in 9th grade physics understand this process.
                  <a href="https://github.com/nhsegal/linearingData/blob/master/3.1%20Linearization%20activity%20wtih%20real%20stuff.pdf">Here is the handout.

                  I have not yet tried out the sim with students. I should probably revisit this code and optimize the noise in the datasets.

                  This sim is essentially a replica of a sim on vectors by PhET at UC Boulder, 
                  which I have found it helpful to illustrate ideas during the first lecture introducing vectors.
                  The PhET sim was originally coded in Flash, and there was a period of several years
                  during which Flash was typically blocked by browsers but PhET had not released an HTML5 version of the sim. 
                  During that time I wrote this sim to practice coding and fill a need. 
                  The interactivity is a little glitchy, but because PhET has now released a new vector sim, 
                  I don't think I will work on the sim further.

                  This sim shows Minkowski Diagrams for two inertial frames in relative motion. The user can alter their velocities and see
                  how the axes change. The constancy of the speed of light, the invariance of the spacetime interval, length contraction, 
                  time dilation, and the relativity of simultaneity can all be explored with this sim.

                  The inspiration for this sim comes from David Mermin's book <i>It's About Time</i>. That book can best describe how to interpret this sim, though I've added a modal that briefly explains it.
                  I have used the sim to illustrate points during lecture and to make figures for worksheets. It depicts the worldlines of two clocks -
                  one colored black, one colored red. The user can adjust the velocity of each clock and see how time dilates accordingly.
                  The user can also chose to display lines marking simultaneous events for the black clock and/or the red clock.
                  I recently rewrote the sim using Desmos. The desmos version is <a href="http://nhsegal.github.io/timedilation/">here</a>. It is slower to respond.

                  The least action sim and the quantum path integral sims were inspired by Feynman's book <i>QED</i> and by sections of <i>Feynman's Lectures in Physics</i>.
                  My apologies for not fully explaining the sims' use here or within the links themselves.

                  I originally thought I could develop something along these lines, before realizing that the project was too ambitious for me.

                    I have not used this in the classroom and have no intention to, but I greatly enjoyed coding this sim.
                    Special thanks to the developer of the <a href="https://github.com/infusion/Complex.js/">Complex.js</a> library.
                    The mouse controls allow the user to pan and zoom.

                    I wanted to explore how Moebius Transformations correspond to motions of the Riemann sphere. 
                    You can use the mouse or trackpad to rotate the POV.

                    Inspired by a challenge from Dan Shiffman. You can use the mouse or trackpad to rotate the cube in space. 
                    Pressing the spacebar will make the cube randomly scramble and then unscramble.
