  <h1>Welcome to My Collection of Projects</h1>
  <p>
    Here are a few physics-teaching related sims that I coded. They won't run in the Safari browsers, but they should work in Firefox or Chrome.
    I have not attempted to make the webpages compatible with tablets or mobile browsers. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://nhsegal.github.io/PopperLab/" >Popper Lab</a></li>
    This is a virtual version a real lab I did with students during the energy unit. Students vary the mass of a projectile launched vertically from a spring toy and measure the maximum height. 
    From these measurements they determine the elastic energy stored in the toy. In the sim, the energy and color of the toy launcher is randomized. The rulers are draggable.
    <p></p>
    <li> <a href="https://nhsegal.github.io/BalanceBoard/" >Balance Board</a></li>
    This is a virtual version of an activity with pegboard that students do to explore torque or center of mass. Although PhET and Physicsclassroom.com have excellent torque sims, 
    I wanted something that clearly showed the vertical placement of the blocks on the pegboard does not affect its balance.
    <p></p>
    <li> <a href ="https://nhsegal.github.io/TheAmazingWaveGame/" >The Amazing Wave Game</a></li>
    Like PhET Waves on a String, but students are challenged to apply their knowledge of interference and reflection to knock over "cups" places near the string. 
    <p></p>
    <li> <a href ="https://nhsegal.github.io/StickyCollisions/" >Sticky Collisions</a></li>
    <p></p>
    <li> <a href ="https://nhsegal.github.io/Explosions/" >Explosions</a></li>
    The two momentum sims above are virtual labs I use for online teaching. I wrote them because all other virtual versions of these activities that I found displayed the momenta, 
    leaving little for students to discover on their own.

        <p></p>
    <li><a href="http://nhsegal.github.io/Bowling-Ball-Activity/" >Bowling Ball Activity</a></li>
    This very rudimentary sim was inspired by a bowling ball activity that I first learned of from physics teacher Mark Schober.
    My students often had difficulty idealizing the results of the physical lab, so this sim was a helpful supplement. 
    I used the handout <a href="https://github.com/nhsegal/Bowling-Ball-Activity/blob/gh-pages/2.0%20Bowling%20Ball%20Activity.pdf">here</a> as a guide for them.
    (If the sim has trouble loading, open the developer console in Chrome or the browser console in Firefox and reload the webpage. You can then close the console window.)<p></p>
    <li><a href="http://nhsegal.github.io/FieldApplet/">Electric Fields</a></li>
    I cannot remember the name and author of the now defunct software program that this sim is based on; it may be <i>EMField</i> by David Trowbridge.
    I used <a href="https://github.com/nhsegal/MyStupidHomepage/blob/master/9.3%20Electric%20Field%20Online%20Activity.docx">this</a> student handout with the sim. <p></p>
    <li><a href="http://nhsegal.github.io/linearizingData/">Linearizing Data</a>
    Both the Modeling Physics curriculum and AP Physics C often ask students to make graphs that "linearize" their data. I developed an activity to help students in 9th grade physics understand this process.
    <a href="https://github.com/nhsegal/linearingData/blob/master/3.1%20Linearization%20activity%20wtih%20real%20stuff.pdf">Here is the handout. </a>The paragraphs in the activity are from <a href="http://www.denofinquiry.com/pdf/DOI%20vol%202%202007.02.03.pdf"><em>A Den of Inquiry</em></a>. I found out about it from Frank Noschese.
    I have not yet tried out the sim with students. I don't think the sim will be as effective as the activity, but it might be an aid students find useful.  <p></p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://nhsegal.github.io/VectorSim/">Vectors</a></li>
    This sim is essentially a replica of a sim on vectors by PhET at UC Boulder.
    The PhET sim is coded in Flash, which is often blocked by browsers. I rewrote it in javascript mostly to
    practice coding. I do not use it for a student activity, but I have found it helpful to illustrate ideas during the first lecture introducing vectors.
    <p></p>
    <li><a href="http://nhsegal.github.io/SRsim/">Spacetime Diagrams without Axes</a></li>
    The inspiration for this sim comes from David Mermin's book <i>It's About Time</i>. That book can best describe how to interpret this sim.
    I have used the sim to illustrate points during lecture and to make figures for worksheets. The sim depicts the worldlines of two clocks -
    one colored black, one colored red. The user can adjust the velocity of each clock and see how time dilates accordingly.
    The user can also chose to display lines marking simultaneous events for the black clock and/or the red clock.
    One can develop a sense of how two clocks in relative motion each measure the other as time dilated.
    <p></p>
    <li><a href="http://nhsegal.github.io/RelativityEngine/">The Special Relativity Engine</a></li>
    Another sim inspired by <i>It's About Time</i>. Mermin devotes a whole chapter in the book to explaining the concept behind this sim.
    (His essay explaining it can also be found in <i>AJP</i> and <i>Boojums All The Way</i>.)
    Here is a link to the student handout.
    <p></p>
    <li><a href="http://nhsegal.github.io/LeastA/">The Principle of Least Action<a></li>
    This sim and the following were inspired by Feynman's book <i>QED</i> and by sections of <i>Feynman's Lectures in Physics</i>.
    My apologies for not fully explaining the sims' use here or within the links themselves.
    Edwin F. Taylor describes educational software and an "Action first" approach to physics <a href="http://www.eftaylor.com/leastaction.html">here</a>.
    I originally thought I could develop something along these lines, before realizing that the project was too ambitious for me.

    <p></p>
    <li><a href="https://nhsegal.github.io/ThreeDGraph/">Riemann Surfaces of Third Degree Polynomials</a></li>
    I have not used this in the classroom and have no intention to, but I greatly enjoyed coding this sim.
    Special thanks to the developer of the <a href="https://github.com/infusion/Complex.js/">Complex.js</a> library.
    <p></p>
    <li><a href="https://nhsegal.github.io/RiemannSphere/">Moebius Transformations and the Riemann Sphere</a></li>
    I wanted to explore how Moebius Transformations correspond to motions of the Riemann sphere. You can use the mouse or trackpad to rotate the POV.
    <p></p>
    <li><a href="https://nhsegal.github.io/RubiksCube/">Rubik's Cube</a></li>
    Inspired by a challenge from Dan Shiffman. You can use the mouse or trackpad to rotate the cube in space. Pressing the spacebar will make the cube randomly scramble and then unscramble.  
  </ul>

    <u>Additional Credits:</u> <br>
In addition to the people and organizations mentioned above I would like to thank the Processing Foundation in general and following people in particular:
Lauren McCarthy for p5.js, John Resig for Processing.js, and Daniel Shiffman for his educational videos and books.
