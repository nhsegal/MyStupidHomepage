      I am a physics teacher who has dabbled a little in coding over the years, and this website hosts some of the math- and physics-related simulations I've coded.  
      Some of these simulations I have used in the classroom or for online teaching. Others were pursued out of personal interest or as exercises in coding. 
      Most were developed using the fabulous <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js library</a>, which unfortunately means they won't run in the 
      Safari browsers but should work in Firefox or Chrome. I have not attempted to make the simulations compatible with tablets or mobile browsers, and some of 
      these sims need a great deal more polish. Nonetheless, I hope they may be of use to others, if not "as-if" then perhaps as inspriration for someone
      to code their own sims for teaching.

                A virtual version of the constant velocity and constant acceleration labs popularized by Modeling Physics. The ruler is draggable.

                  This is a virtual version of a real lab I did with students during the energy unit. Students vary the mass of a projectile launched vertically from a spring toy and measure the maximum height. 
                  From these measurements they determine the elastic energy stored in the toy. In the sim, the energy and color of the toy launcher is randomized. The rulers are draggable.

                This is a virtual version of an activity with pegboard that students do to explore torque or center of mass. Although PhET and Physicsclassroom.com have excellent torque sims, 
                I wanted something that clearly showed that the vertical placement of the blocks on the pegboard does not affect the conditions for equilibrium.

                I cannot remember the name and author of the now defunct software program that this sim is based on; it may be <i>EMField</i> by David Trowbridge.

                    This very rudimentary sim was inspired by a bowling ball activity that I first learned of from physics teacher Mark Schober.
                    My students often had difficulty idealizing the results of the physical lab, so this sim was a helpful supplement. 
                    I used the handout <a href="https://github.com/nhsegal/Bowling-Ball-Activity/blob/gh-pages/2.0%20Bowling%20Ball%20Activity.pdf">here</a> as a guide for them.
                    (If the sim has trouble loading, open the developer console in Chrome or the browser console in Firefox and reload the webpage. You can then close the console window.)

                  Like PhET Waves on a String, but students are challenged to apply their knowledge of interference and reflection to knock over "cups" places near the string. 
                  I tried coding the physics for wave motion in three or four ways. I learned a lot about the sorts of errors that result from various physical approximations, 
                  but I ended up back where I started with not much to show for my efforts.

                Students experimentally determine the relationship between the spacing of two wave sources and the angle between interference maxima. 
                The slider controls the spacing and the red circle can be moved to measure angles.
                Students can then apply the relationship they determined to find the wavelength of a real laser with a reall double slit and ruler. 
                I do this lab in the classroom with concentric circles printed on overhead transparencies. 
                It is easier for the students to follow than deriving the relationship using similar triangles and small angle approximations.

                  Both the Modeling Physics curriculum and AP Physics C often ask students to make graphs that "linearize" their data. 
                  I developed an activity to help students in 9th grade physics understand this process.
                  <a href="https://github.com/nhsegal/linearingData/blob/master/3.1%20Linearization%20activity%20wtih%20real%20stuff.pdf">Here is the handout. 
                  </a>The paragraphs in the activity are from <a href="http://www.denofinquiry.com/pdf/DOI%20vol%202%202007.02.03.pdf"><em>A Den of Inquiry</em></a>. I found out about it from Frank Noschese.
                  I have not yet tried out the sim with students. I should probably revisit this code and optimize the noise in the datasets.

                  This sim is essentially a replica of a sim on vectors by PhET at UC Boulder, 
                  which I have found it helpful to illustrate ideas during the first lecture introducing vectors.
                  The PhET sim was originally coded in Flash, and there was a period of several years
                  during which Flash was typically blocked by browsers but PhET had not released an HTML5 version of the sim. 
                  During that time I wrote this sim to practice coding and fill a need. 
                  The interactivity is a little glitchy, but because PhET has now released a new vector sim, 
                  I don't think I will work on the sim further.

                  The inspiration for this sim comes from David Mermin's book <i>It's About Time</i>. That book can best describe how to interpret this sim.
                  I have used the sim to illustrate points during lecture and to make figures for worksheets. The sim depicts the worldlines of two clocks -
                  one colored black, one colored red. The user can adjust the velocity of each clock and see how time dilates accordingly.
                  The user can also chose to display lines marking simultaneous events for the black clock and/or the red clock.
                  One can develop a sense of how two clocks in relative motion each measure the other as time dilated.

                    Another sim inspired by <i>It's About Time</i>. Mermin devotes a whole chapter in the book to explaining the concept behind this sim.
                    (His essay explaining it can also be found in <i>AJP</i> and <i>Boojums All The Way</i>.)

                    The least action sim and the quantum path integral sims were inspired by Feynman's book <i>QED</i> and by sections of <i>Feynman's Lectures in Physics</i>.
                    My apologies for not fully explaining the sims' use here or within the links themselves.
                    Edwin F. Taylor describes educational software and an "Action first" approach to physics <a href="http://www.eftaylor.com/leastaction.html">here</a>.
                    I originally thought I could develop something along these lines, before realizing that the project was too ambitious for me.

                    I have not used this in the classroom and have no intention to, but I greatly enjoyed coding this sim.
                    Special thanks to the developer of the <a href="https://github.com/infusion/Complex.js/">Complex.js</a> library.
                    The mouse controls allow the user to pan and zoom.

                    I wanted to explore how Moebius Transformations correspond to motions of the Riemann sphere. 
                    You can use the mouse or trackpad to rotate the POV.

                    Inspired by a challenge from Dan Shiffman. You can use the mouse or trackpad to rotate the cube in space. 
                    Pressing the spacebar will make the cube randomly scramble and then unscramble.
